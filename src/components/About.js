      <h6>Codrut Nistor - Senior Tech Writer - 5667 articles published on iNotebookcheck since 2013</h6>
      <p>In my early school days, I hated writing and having to make up stories. A decade later, I started to enjoy it. Since then, I published a few offline articles and then I moved to the online space, where I contributed to major websites that are still present online as of 2021 such as Softpedia, Brothersoft, Download3000, but I also wrote for multiple blogs that have disappeared over the years. I've been riding with the Notebookcheck crew since 2013 and I am not planning to leave it anytime soon. In love with good mechanical keyboards, vinyl and tape sound, but also smartphones, streaming services, and digital art.

  <h1>Working For iNotebook </h1>
iNotebook is looking for a couple of highly motivated tech writers who are based in Australia/New Zealand/Oceania.
As an independent freelancer, you can work wherever and whenever you want. For the most part, you only need a computer and access to the internet.

<h2> Translators </h2>

<h5> Task </h5> 

iNotebook translators translate reviews and other articles at home and put the translated content in our Typo3 CMS. Deadlines do not exist but the content should be available as fast as possible as the topics soon become dated.

Logically, this system applies only to language sections, which we already maintain. If you want to translate to Polish, we will refer you to the licensee who maintains this language section.

The use of automatic translation software is prohibited, even as a support tool.

<h5> Payment </h5> 

We pay translators a pre-determined rate per source word or flat rate per translated article. Contact us for the current price for a specific language.

<h5> Application </h5> 

Curriculum vitae, references, a description of why you are suitable for the position, and a sample review/text (optional).
